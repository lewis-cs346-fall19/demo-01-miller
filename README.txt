For this lab, you have two python files. You have the server side and the client
side. The server side is responsible for listening for the clients requests. 
Once the server accepts the connection and the connection is made, the client
can input any request. The server will recieve the message and state it in
terminal. Once the user types quit, both the server and the client end will
terminate.
